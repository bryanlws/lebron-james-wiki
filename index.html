            <h2>About</h2><hr>
            LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los
            Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed "King James", he is widely considered one of the
            best players in NBA history, James is frequently compared to Michael Jordan in debates over the greatest basketball
            player ever. The only player to have won NBA championships with three franchises (the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Miami
            Heat, and the Lakers) as NBA Finals MVP, James has competed in ten NBA Finals, eight of them consecutively with the
            Heat and the Cavaliers from 2011–2018. His accomplishments include four NBA championships, four NBA MVP awards, four NBA
            Finals MVP awards, and two Olympic gold medals. During his 17-year career, James holds the record for all-time playoffs
            points, is third in all-time points, and eighth in career assists. James has been selected to the All-NBA Team a record
            17 times (with a record of 13 First Team selections and 11 consecutive First Team selections, the latter of which is
            shared with Jordan and Karl Malone), made the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times, and has been named an All-Star 17
            times, including three All-Star MVP selections.
